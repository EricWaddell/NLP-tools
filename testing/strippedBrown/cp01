	They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man . 
	Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early June ; ; never called him by name , although he had one . 
	The only thing unusual about the Old Man had long since happened . 
	`` But she shouldn't have come here in the first place '' , the women had said . 
	`` No , no . 
	`` Eh , Torino ! ! It's not for making pretty speeches about Dante those actresses get paid so good '' . 
	`` Henh '' ! ! if the Old Man even thought about his wife now , nobody cared a fig . 
	Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife . 
	There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him . 
	Sameness for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city . 
	Even the stable-garage , which housed nothing now but the scent of rot , had a lawn before it . 
	Only one house on the street had no lawn before it . 
	Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks -- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill , rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery . 
	The Old Man silently fed upon these streets . 
	He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his heritage , and he couldn't have cared less about that either . 
	When he would be a man , he would be a rich man . 
	`` Hey , Laura '' ! ! did not answer him . 
	Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii . 
	Pompeii called again , `` Laura '' ! ! She's in a mood '' , he thought `` There's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood '' . 
	Well , what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about ? ? he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin , and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue , feasting against the salt taste of him . 
	`` Christ sake , goat , git '' ! ! You're boiling milk , ain't you '' ? ? him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud . 
	The Old Man near the corner let the shadow pass over him , sensing something portentous in it . 
	In the meantime , six sandals , stained an ocher , the same color as Pompeii's shaved hair , edged up close to him . 
	He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to Niobe , the neatest ones to Concetta , and the laced ones to Romeo , Concetta's idiot brother .
