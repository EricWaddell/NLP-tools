	Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to `` lift all those old barbell things '' because `` you'll stunt your growth '' or because childish taunts from his schoolmates , like `` Hey lookit Mr. America ; ; all , a guy's gotta have a little ego ! ! it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ! ! happy , always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy . 
	Far from discouraging Henri , his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments . 
	And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better hands because `` le professeur '' knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still , he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast , fast muscle growth . 
	That's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal . 
	Now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds , and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight . 
	Well , sir they did real great ! ! has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much . 
	That's when he went to Professor Claude . 
	So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous `` moon '' bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover ( the `` pull '' part of the Push-Pull Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide , Reeves-type `` gladiator '' pecs , while stimulating the upper lats and frontal deltoids . 
	As you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ! ! when Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 2 . 
	Super-Set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises , but this time done with dumbbells , and using both `` moon '' and flat benches . 
	The `` pull '' exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell Bent-Arm Pullover . 
	In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the `` push '' exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars , while the `` pull '' exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms . 
	The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ! ! as you can also see , it's not a painful exercise at all , because Henri De Courcy -- the `` happy '' bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ! ! last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise , done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets . 
	This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests ; ; with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No. 1 , four of No. 2 , four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press , you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building , muscle-shaping , torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon . 
	Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone . 
	Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light-weight workouts . 
	Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others . 
	The exercise I shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the One Leg Lunge . 
	It is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders ; ; of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable . 
	But for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular Squatting , Leg Curling , Leg Extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed . 
	Really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times , for the following suggestions show why it is so effective : 1 . -hl
	You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done : 1 . -hl
	Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg , without moving your feet . 
	That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell . 
	Oh , you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first . 
	Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck .
