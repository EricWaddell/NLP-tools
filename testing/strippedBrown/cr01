	Mills secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of Cal Barco . 
	On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants . 
	The detectives placed Barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning . 
	Thus it was that Barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered . 
	However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life . 
	Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case . 
	It was reported to Welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide . 
	`` Barco , we've got the goods on you ! ! first Barco was evasive and shifty . 
	Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell . 
	`` Is that so '' ? ? next day the police captain , in derision , organized what he termed `` Welch's Wild Goose Chase '' . 
	Barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on . 
	Orders were given to dig . 
	With quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging . 
	`` There's something here '' ! ! did Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him . 
	It was apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power as D.A. to drag every possible sensation into the case . 
	I knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand . 
	I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted . 
	One day over a year before , there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel . 
	Naturally , Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all politeness to her host . 
	As Viola sat there , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes . 
	A little later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture Forum on `` The Civic Spirit of the Southland '' , in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to preside . 
	The incident , aside from reflecting on Welch's political career , had all but wrecked his home life . 
	During these first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked . 
	Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her . 
	Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school . 
	However , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother . 
	When I arrived at Viola's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . 
	I sat and watched proceedings .
