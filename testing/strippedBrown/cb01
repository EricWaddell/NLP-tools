	There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight , in which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers . 
	Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government . 
	In all the turmoil , some good legislation was passed . 
	No action has been taken , however , on such major problems as ending the fee system , penal reform , modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales . 
	The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions . 
	We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation . 
	These women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's dictum that one must cherish the people's spirit but `` Keep alive their attention '' . 
	`` If once they become inattentive to the public affairs '' , Jefferson said , `` you and I , and Congress and assemblies , judges and governors , shall all become wolves '' . 
	Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs . 
	Coupling its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000 state grant authorized by Gov. Vandiver , the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech. . 
	The undertaking has abundant promise . 
	The danger lay not in believing that our own A-bombs would deter Russia's use of hers ; ; limiting American strength too much to nuclear strength , this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war . 
	It also weakened our diplomatic stance , because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity . 
	This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity . 
	By maintaining the nuclear deterrent , but gearing American military forces to fight conventional wars too , Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position . 
	It includes a raise in the county minimum wage , creation of several new jobs at the executive level , financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts , and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare , fire protection , sanitation and road maintenance . 
	That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners , headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed , and other county officials . 
	The firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning . 
	Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost from the General Assembly in the form of a $1,750,000 budget increase for the Milledgeville State Hospital . 
	Actually it amounts to $1,250,000 above what the institution already is receiving , considering the additional half-million dollars Gov. Vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus . 
	Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is . 
	The practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished . 
	More attendants , nurses and doctors should be hired . 
	Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year , Georgia will be spending only around $3.15 per day per patient . 
	Georgia has made some reforms , true . 
	Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done , it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted . 
	Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination . 
	The recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive . 
	El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth . 
	Until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article of faith with Trujillo , and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character . 
	Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines . 
	What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle . 
	Because the buses would not stop on the parkway , land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed .
