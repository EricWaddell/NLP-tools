	Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration . 
	The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North . 
	I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience . 
	I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical ? ? American liberal may , in the world of to-day , have a strong case ; ; am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South . 
	I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North . 
	Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice , especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view . 
	There are of course many Souths ; ; in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones . 
	The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering , and there the memory is more precious , and the consciousness of loss the greater . 
	Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors . 
	It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise . 
	If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true . 
	The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries . 
	The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners , harsh accents , lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure .
