	There were thirty-eight patients on the bus the morning I left for Hanover , most of them disturbed and hallucinating . 
	I felt lonely and depressed as I stared out the bus window at Chicago's grim , dirty West Side . 
	I suddenly thought of Mary Jane Brennan , the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger , her quiet competence , the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses . 
	We had become good friends during my stay at Cook County Hospital . 
	`` I read those newspaper stories about you '' , she had said . 
	`` Why do you say that '' ? ? ! ! Would it make any difference to you if I were , Mary Jane '' ? ? met my eyes , suddenly angry . 
	`` You what , Mary Jane '' ? ? You are young , intelligent , have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself , but you mess it up with whiskey , indifference , self-destructive attitudes . 
	`` Oh , yes '' , I said , feeling annoyed , `` she was very pretty . 
	`` Why should I ? ? Why didn't you '' ? ? eyes flashed angrily . 
	`` Do you have a boy friend '' ? ? That's none of your business '' , she said , then changed the subject . 
	`` My father and mother died when I was two years old '' , I said . 
	Something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly , and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face . 
	`` I'm sorry '' , she said . 
	`` Tell me more about them '' . 
	Her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother , aunts and uncles , cousins . 
	`` Your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman . 
	`` My father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to Homicide for five years . 
	`` What about you ? ? If I thought you were serious about going back to school , that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at Hanover -- well , I might consider such an offer . 
	It suddenly seemed very important to me that Mary Jane Brennan should know the truth about me -- that I was not the confused , sick , irresponsible person she believed me to be . 
	`` There are things about me that I can't tell you now , Mary Jane '' , I said , `` but if you'll go out to dinner with me when I get out of Hanover , I'd like to tell you the whole story . 
	`` Yes , I'll get one overnight a month '' . 
	`` We'll go up to the Edgewater Beach Hotel for dinner '' , I said . 
	`` I like to dance '' , she said , then turned and walked away . 
	There hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in me . 
	Now , riding this hospital bus , feeling isolated and utterly alone , I knew that she was genuine and unique , quite unlike any girl I had known before . 
	It was a fantastic story . 
	As the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward Hanover I settled back in my seat and closed my eyes , thinking over the events of the past two weeks , trying to put the pieces in order . 
	Such optimism was completely unjustified . 
	We were paid off Tuesday morning and given tickets back to New York . 
	I felt lonely and depressed as I packed my bags at the Croydon Hotel . 
	I closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up , then went to the bathroom for a drink of water . 
	`` All right '' , I said . 
	`` I beg your pardon , sir '' ? ? All right . 
	`` Good . 
	I smiled . 
	`` Yes , of course , Mr. Nelson '' . 
	I started to say something else appropriate , but the man had hung up . 
	I finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of Ask Tony . 
	`` All right , you bastards '' , I said , `` the great actor is about to buy a drink '' . 
	I laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round . 
	`` You Mr. Nelson '' ? ? That's right '' . 
	`` Mr. Wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east entrance '' . 
	I followed him out through the lobby to the street . 
	An ancient Rolls-Royce , as shiningly impressive as the day it came off the ship , was parked at the curb .
