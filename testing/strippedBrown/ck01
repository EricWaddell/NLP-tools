	Scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments . 
	He was discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his parents had what Mr. McKinley described as a `` celebration lunch '' at the cafeteria on the campus . 
	Teachers -- men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles -- came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty and Rachel . 
	`` The blueberry pie is good , Scotty . 
	`` He's all right , Craig '' , Rachel said . 
	Since his seizure , Scotty had had little appetite ; ; had little to say . 
	Rachel said , `` I'd better get him to bed '' . 
	The doctors had suggested Scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger . 
	Since Mr. McKinley had to give a lecture , Rachel and Scotty drove home alone in the Plymouth . 
	Scotty looked at the children , his mouth slightly opened , his eyes dull . 
	`` You don't eat enough , honey . 
	Rachel , observing , would say , `` He has to rediscover his own capacity . 
	Virginia and Rachel talked to each other quietly now , as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere . 
	He had not mentioned Kate . 
	Rachel mentioned Kate . 
	Scotty said , `` That's all right . 
	Once , sitting at the front window in his parents' room , he saw Kate come out of her house . 
	The doctor , since Scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him , came often and informally to the house . 
	`` Husky young man '' , he said with mock distaste . 
	`` I don't go to school any more '' . 
	`` Pardon '' ? ? stayed on after the doctor had gone . 
	She said , `` Do you think you'll miss school '' ? ? had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel had grown . 
	`` We've had any number of calls about you . 
	Scotty shrugged slightly . 
	She turned to him again . 
	Scotty said , `` I don't know '' . 
	`` Well , there's time , in any case . 
	Scotty said , `` Okay '' . 
	This time Rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead . 
	His father was a constant visitor . 
	`` How's Scotty '' ? ? Rachel's or Virginia's reply : `` better . 
	`` Is his appetite improved '' ? ? exchange was almost invariable , and Scotty , in his bed , could hear every word of it . 
	Scotty would reply softly and his father , apologetically , would ask him to repeat . 
	`` I'm eating more '' , he would say . 
	`` Perhaps you should get out a little '' . 
	`` I'm not supposed to yet '' . 
	Mr. McKinley examined everything with critical care , seeking something material to blame for his son's illness . 
	`` Have you got enough blankets '' ? ?
