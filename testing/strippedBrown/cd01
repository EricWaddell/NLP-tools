	One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit . 
	The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it . 
	All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing . 
	The situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible , which deals with the Salem witch trials . 
	As the play unfolds , however , the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community . 
	If one asks about this play , what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power , there is no better answer to give than `` spirit '' . 
	Even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this score . 
	Apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real . 
	There is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit . 
	In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit , the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful . 
	One characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness .
