	It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin . 
	There was about that song something incandescent , for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat . 
	That is , when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music , sparks flying , bow shredding , violin singing , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr. Hendl could go along . 
	The concert opened with another big romantic score , Schumann's Overture to `` Manfred '' , which suffered fate , this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat . 
	Remember how by a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet ? ? you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming , not once but several times , indeed we did . 
	A couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told `` the newspapers had made a mistake '' . 
	Queried about the impasse , Allied Arts said : `` Better cancel the Kirov for the time being . 
	So the Kirov will fly back to Russia , minus a Chicago engagement , a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers , cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country . 
	Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium ? ? and drawings by Marie Moore of St. Thomas , Virgin Islands , are shown thru Nov. 5 at the Meadows Gallery , 3211 Ellis Av. , week days , 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. , Sundays 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. , closed Mondays . 
	In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget , the Dallas Civic Opera will use San Francisco's new Leni Bauer-Ecsy production of `` Lucia Di Lammermoor '' this season , returning the favor next season when San Francisco uses the Dallas `` Don Giovanni '' , designed by Franco Zeffirelli . 
	H E. Bates has scribbled a farce called `` Hark , Hark , The Lark '' ! ! there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans , it is hard to find . 
	Anyway , a number of them meet here in devastating collisions . 
	What's up now ? ? want to own a junior-grade castle , or a manor house , or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers . 
	They are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at . 
	He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor . 
	Larkin has an answer to all that . 
	It's a wonder , really , to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse . 
	For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot . 
	And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it . 
	Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc . 
	First the Larkins are ahead , then the Jerebohms . 
	He doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting . 
	It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes' `` Don Quixote '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle , done in wide screen and color , which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses . 
	More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire , Sancho Panza , in seventeenth-century Spain , this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character . 
	His addle-brained knight-errant , self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke , is , as Cervantes no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics , hypocrites and rogues . 
	Cherkasov does not caricature him , as some actors have been inclined to do . 
	The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue . 
	Splendid , too , is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev , one of Russia's leading comedians , as Sancho Panza , the fat , grotesque `` squire '' . 
	The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an `` island '' is one of the best in the film . 
	There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange . 
	Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called `` Sunday In Greenwich Village '' , a tour of the haunts and joints .
