	Dan Morgan told himself he would forget Ann Turner . 
	But all of this was rationalization . 
	The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work . 
	He had plenty of work to do . 
	He had no idea how much time Budd would give him . 
	When , in late afternoon on the last day in June , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle . 
	He cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his Winchester , and started downstream . 
	Reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his Winchester in his hands . 
	Morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one . 
	Morgan jerked his head toward the front door . 
	She didn't move or say anything . 
	Her blond hair was frowzy , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection . 
	He picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house . 
	He put her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table . 
	Morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth . 
	He stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition . 
	The girl dropped off to sleep . 
	`` Who are you and what happened to you '' ? ? I'm Billy Jones '' , the boy answered . 
	`` What are you doing here '' ? ? Are we in Wyoming '' ? ? nodded . 
	Jones sighed as if relieved . 
	`` You mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work '' ? ? We didn't want town work '' , Jones said . 
	`` This is a mighty empty country '' , Morgan said . 
	`` Then we're lucky we got here . 
	`` Morgan . 
	He was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple . 
	There was more to this than Jones had told him . 
	`` I could use some help '' , Morgan said finally , `` but I can't afford to pay you anything . 
	`` We'll work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly . 
	`` I'll see '' , Morgan said . 
	`` I know '' , Jones said dejectedly . 
	Morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table . 
	She rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair . 
	`` I'm Dan Morgan . 
	`` Oh '' . 
	`` I don't have many strays coming to my front door '' , he said . 
	`` Of course '' . 
	She got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell . 
	`` And hungry '' , he said . 
	`` Not much of a meal '' ? ? told himself he had never seen two people eat so much . 
	The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed of himself . 
	Morgan laughed . 
	`` We're not drunkards '' , she said . 
	She helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark . 
	`` No , she'll be all right '' , Jones said quickly . 
	`` We'll see '' , Morgan said . 
	`` Could you find me a needle and thread '' ? ? nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors . 
	`` You're awfully kind '' , the girl said . 
	`` It's all right '' , he said . 
	Jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him . 
	He stopped , embarrassed , and Morgan said , `` I understand that , but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' . 
	`` We got fired '' , Jones said . 
	They were a pair of lost , whipped kids , Morgan thought as he went to bed .
